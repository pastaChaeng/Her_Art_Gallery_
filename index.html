        <h3>Thomas Shelby Insp | Coffee Paint</h3>
        <p>The artwork captures his mysterious persona, expressing his intricacies and the hardships he endures in his desire of power and control. The use of coffee as a medium gives the painting a distinct texture and tonal character, offering it a rustic and raw feel.</p>
